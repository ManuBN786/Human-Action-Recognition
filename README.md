A Matlab code is written to recognize human actions namely 'walking', 'jogging','running', 'boxing','hand waving', and 'hand clapping' using Spatio Temporal Interest Points (STIP) and classify the same using a KNN classifier. Please download the KTH Action recognition dataset from the link http://www.nada.kth.se/cvap/actions/ and put them in the folder KTH Dataset folder.
How to run ??
1. Place the 'Action Recognition Code' folder in the Matlab Path, add all the folder and subfolder to the path
2. Run Recognize.m
3. Select a video from the KTH Dataset
4. Observe results
The code is loosely based on the paper below, please cite and give credit to the authors:
